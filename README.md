# Project 6 - Extended Kalman Filter in C++

The goal of this project is to create an Extended Kalman filter
implementation in C++. 

The project reads both sequential sample radar
and lidar measurement data from the files in the data folder
and estimates the positions and velocities in two dimensions.
These estimates are performed using the Extended Kalman Filter
equations.
